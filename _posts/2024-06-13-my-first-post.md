# Welcome to my first Post!
I really recommend you following sites, to get more knowledge about this framework:  
[Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)  
[Chirpy Post Guide](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/write-a-new-post/)  
[Chirpy Repository](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/blob/master/_config.yml)


## Create a new Post

```shell
bundle exec jekyll page "My New Page"
```
Change the title, the content, the categories and the tags of the new page in the file `_posts/my-new-page.md`.

Optionally, you can add a description to the page.
