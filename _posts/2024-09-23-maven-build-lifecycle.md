# Maven Build Lifecycle
The Maven build lifecycle consists of three phases: clean, default, and site. Each phase consists of a sequence of goals. The default phase is the most important one, as it is the one that is executed when you run the mvn command without any arguments.

## Clean Phase
The clean phase is responsible for cleaning up the project. It removes all files generated by the previous build. The clean phase is executed when you run the mvn clean command.

## Default Phase
The default phase is the most important one. It is the one that is executed when you run the mvn command without any arguments. The default phase consists of the following phases:

- validate - checks the project is correct and all necessary information is available
- compile - compiles the source code of the project
- test - tests the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
- package - packages the compiled code in its distributable format, such as a JAR
- verify - runs any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria
- install - installs the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
- deploy - copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects

## Site Phase
The site phase is responsible for generating the project's documentation. It generates the project's website, including reports, and other documentation. The site phase is executed when you run the mvn site command.

## Conclusion
The Maven build lifecycle consists of three phases: clean, default, and site. Each phase consists of a sequence of goals. The default phase is the most important one, as it is the one that is executed when you run the mvn command without any arguments.
