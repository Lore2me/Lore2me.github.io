Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior. It is intended to improve nonfunctional attributes of the software. The main purpose of refactoring is to maintain the code clean, easy to understand, and easy to maintain. Refactoring is usually motivated by noticing a code smell. Code smells are indicators that the code may need refactoring.

The rule of three is a code refactoring rule of thumb
to decide when a new procedure should replace a replicated piece of code.
It states that you are allowed to copy and paste the code once,
but that when the same code is replicated three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure.
The rule was popularized by Martin Fowler in his book Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code. The rule of three is a compromise between the two extremes of refactoring too early and refactoring too late. It is a good rule of thumb to follow when deciding when to refactor your code.

The scout rule is a similar rule that states that when you see a code smell, you should refactor it immediately.
Leave a place cleaner than you found it.
