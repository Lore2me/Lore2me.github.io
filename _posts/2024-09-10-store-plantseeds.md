# Store Plantseeds
Have you ever buyed plantseeds and forgot to plant them? Or you have a lot of seeds and you don't know how to store them? In this post, we will talk about how to store plantseeds.

## How long can you store plantseeds?
Generally the seeds a customer can buy in a store have a quality of min 85%. Means that 85 of 100 seeds should grow, if you plant them.
Over time the quality will decrease. So a customer needs to plant more seeds to get the same amount of plants.

The quality of the seeds is important for the storage time. The better the quality, the longer the seeds can be stored. The storage time of seeds is also influenced by the storage conditions. The seeds should be stored in a cool, dark and dry place. The seeds should not be exposed to direct sunlight, high temperatures or high temperature variations. The seeds should also be stored in airtight containers to prevent moisture from getting in. Moisture could cause the seeds to germinate prematurely or to rot.
